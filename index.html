    Welcome!

    This website is still under construction.

    My <a href="http://isadeh.com/old-website/">old website</a> is still live.

    You can find my C++ textbook <a href="http://isadeh.com/cplusplusBook/">here</a>, however I havent maintained it for a while.

    Currently I am working on organizing my AP CSA (Java) Teaching materials into a textbook. Most of my materials can be found here, and the textbook will eventually be here. (Chapters 1 and 2 are up)
